# WTSP_VIPMethylation

This respository contains the scripts and data to reproduce the analyses from Prichard et al., 2022 (under review).

This data analysis can be reproduced using the R script and files included here. The script and analyses were conducted in R Studio (RStudio 2022.07.1+554 "Spotted Wakerobin"). The script skips the step of reading in the individual read counts that are the output from bismark. The code for that step is included but not intended to be run on the files in this respository. The WTSP_VIPMethylation.html file includes the entire analyses for both age groups as a R markdown report. The code for that report is nearly identical to the R script.
